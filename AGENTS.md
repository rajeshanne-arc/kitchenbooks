# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# KitchenBooks — rules for working in this repo

Purchase-bill bookkeeping for one restaurant (Thrayam). Supabase Postgres
project `xvnreydzveicnzmhkire`; the schema lives in the database — read it from
there (`supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` holds the DDL), never invent
columns.

Hard rules — these mirror database-level enforcement, do not soften them:

1. **DB access is server-side only** (server actions / route handlers via
   `src/lib/db.ts`, which is `server-only`). No Supabase key exists in this
   app; the one secret is `DATABASE_URL` (.env.local, never committed). The
   `kb_app` role it connects as has SELECT + INSERT only.
2. **Never UPDATE or DELETE events** (`purchases`, `purchase_lines`,
   `payments`). Corrections are reversal rows: negative values with
   `reverses_id` pointing at the original. The DB role physically cannot
   UPDATE/DELETE — don't add code that tries.
3. **Masters are born inline** in the bill flow (no vendor/item admin pages in
   this phase). Codes auto-assign inside the save transaction:
   vendors `V-<CAT>-NN`, items `<CAT>-NNN`, sequential per restaurant+category.
4. **Displayed derived numbers come from named views** (`vendor_dues.balance`,
   `item_rates.prefill_rate`) — never recompute them client-side. Post-save
   figures are read back from the DB, not echoed from input.

Money math: exact integers only (`src/lib/money.ts`) — paise for amounts,
milli-units for quantities, bigint 10⁻⁵₹ for line values; decimal strings in
and out of Postgres `numeric`. `amount`, `landed`, and `bill_total` are
GENERATED columns — always insert with explicit column lists.

Transport allocates pro-rata by line value at 2 dp, residual paise on the
largest line so shares always sum exactly (`allocateTransport`).

Testing: `npm run smoke` — end-to-end against the real DB; prints created ids
for manual cleanup (expects an events-empty DB for its code assertions).

The app must stay first-class with an empty database: zero vendors and zero
items is the normal starting state, not an error.
